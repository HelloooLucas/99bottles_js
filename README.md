# Goal of the challenge 

You will design a small program to solve the 99Bottles challenge. 

You need to make the code : 
- easy to understand / maintain
- easy to change
- bug free 
  

First design round, checkout the `first-round` branch and make the test pass. 

Second design round, checkout the `second-round` branch and make the test pass. 
- The second iteration will add a new case. 

Resist the urge to read the 2nd round tests before you do the first round.
